今夜醉酒，写信，读书。读到 *The Fountainhead* 这段，突然感到和 Howard Roack 强烈的共情。

{{< admonition note "The Fountainhead page 119" true >}}

Roark's five months with Snyte stretched behind him like a blank. Had he wished to ask himself what
he had felt, he would have found no answer, save in the fact that he remembered nothing of these months.
He could remember each sketch he had made. He could, if he tried, remember what had happened to
those sketches; he did not try.

又因此想起了一首还没那么醉的时候读过的诗

{{< admonition note "Melancholia" true >}}

the history of melancholia

includes all of us.

<br>


me, I writhe in dirty sheets

while staring at blue walls

and nothing.

<br>


I have gotten so used to melancholia

that

I greet it like an old

friend.

<br>


I will now do 15 minutes of grieving

for the lost redhead,

I tell the gods.

<br>


I do it and feel quite bad

quite sad,

then I rise

CLEANSED

even though nothing is

solved.

<br>


that’s what I get for kicking

religion in the ass.

<br>


I should have kicked the redhead

in the ass

where her brains and her bread and

butter are

at…

<br>


but, no, I’ve felt sad

about everything:

the lost redhead was just another

smash in a lifelong

loss…

<br>


I listen to drums on the radio now

and grin.

<br>


there is something wrong with me

besides

melancholia.

无论如何，这一天依旧是充满慰藉。
